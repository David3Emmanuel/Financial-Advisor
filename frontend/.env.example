# Backend API URL for server-side proxy
# This is used by server.js to forward API requests to the backend
# NOT used by the browser (browsers use relative paths like /api/analyze)

# For local development:
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For Railway deployment with private networking (recommended):
# BACKEND_URL=http://backend.railway.internal:8000
# Note: Replace "backend" with your actual Railway backend service name

# For Railway deployment with public backend URL:
# BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
